# FastAPI-Projects
This repository includes several backend web development projects implemented with the Python's FastAPI Framework. 

Note: This repository also includes a recap of all Python topics (such as Object-Oriented Programming in Python, Dictonaries, Variables, Strings, Tuples, Functions, Functional Scopes, Global Scopes, and so forth) along with some related code examples and/or mini projects. 


Book Management System Backend Project (Project#1):

This project demonstrates the usage of CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations by using HTTP Methods such as GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.
It involves examples of passing path parameters, passing query parameters, and creating several HTTP Request Methods (GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE).

Books Project with HTTP Error Handling, Data Parsing, Instance Variable Validation, Query Parameter Validation, and Path Parameter Validation (Project#2):

This project is similar to the Project#1. However, it also involves some important concepts like http error handling, instance variable validation,
query parameter validation, and path parameter validation. This project performs the data parsing, field validation, path parameter validation and 
query parameter validation by using the Pydantic library of Python.
