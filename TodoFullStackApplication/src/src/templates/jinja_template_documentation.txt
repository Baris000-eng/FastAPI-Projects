# What is Jinja Template ?

# Jinja tags allow developers to be confident while working with backend data, using tags that are similar
to HTML.

# Jinja template is a fast, extensible, and expressive templating language.

# It is able to write code similar to the Python in the DOM model.

# Example:

In the todos.py file,

context: {
   "todos": todo_list
}

In the homepage.html file,

{% for todo in todos %}
   Do something with todo
{% endfor %}

# We can also use Jinja templating language with if else statements. It is shown below:

{% if todos %}
   Displaying: {{ todos|length }} Todos
{% else % }
   You don't have any todos :)
{% endif % }

In the Jinja templating, we end the for loop with '{% endfor %} while ending the if statement with '{% endif %}'

# The template is passed data to render
