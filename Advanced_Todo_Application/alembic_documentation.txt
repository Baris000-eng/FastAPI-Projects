What is Alembic ?

- Alembic is a lightweight database migration tool for when using SQLAlchemy. It is a
- powerful migration tool that allows us to change our database schemes.
- Migration tools allow us to plan, upgrade, and transfer resources within databases.
- Alembic allows us to change a SQLAlchemy database table after it has already been created.
- Currently SQLAlchemy will only create new database tables for us, not improve any.

Note: As our application evolves, our database will need to evolve as well.

How does Alembic work ?

- Alembic provides the creation and call of the change management scripts. This allows you
to be able to create migration environments and be able to change data how you want.

- Alembic helps us to be able to keep modifying our database to keep up with the rapid
- development requirements.

- Alembic allows us to be able to continually create additional content that works
- within our application.

Important Note: "pip install alembic" command will download all of the dependencies
to be able to use alembic in our project.

Alembic Commands

Alembic Command                         Details of the Command
alembic init <folder name>              It initializes a new and generic environment.
alembic revision -m <message>           It creates a new revision of the environment. Change and migration of database happens with this command.
alembic upgrade <revision id #>         It runs our upgrade migration to our database.
alembic downgrade -1                    It runs our downgrade migration to our database.


Alembic.ini file

1-) This is the file that alembic looks for when being invoked.
2-) It contains a bunch of configuration information for Alembic
which we are able to change to match our project.

Alembic Directory

1-) The Alembic directory has all environmental properties for alembic.
2-) It holds all revisions of your applications (for the data integrity and migration)
3-) It is the place where the migrations for upgrading or downgrading can be called.

Alembic Revisions

* Alembic revision is how we create a new alembic file where we can add some
type of database upgrade.

* 'alembic revision -m "create phone number col on users table"' command
creates a new file where we can write the upgrade code.

* Each new revision will have a revision id. This is the unique identifier
assigned to each Alembic revision.

* Alembic upgrade is how we actually run the data migration.

* The existing data within database does not change while running an Alembic upgrade.

- To run the alembic upgrade migration, we can use the below command:
alembic upgrade <revision id>

Alembic Downgrade

* Alembic downgrade is how we revert a migration. It is supposed to revert
our database to remove the last migration change.

- To run the alembic downgrade migration, we can use the below command:
alembic downgrade -1

- 'alembic downgrade -1' command will revert the last migration.
